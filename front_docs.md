1. use **styled-components** to enhance CSS for styling React component

It turns css into js files and makes maintenance a lot easier. So we don't have to hunt across different files to find the styling affecting a specific component.

```bash
npm install styled-components
```

2. use **redux** to manage data and components

```bash
npm install redux
```
[redux](https://redux.js.org/)

3. use **React-Redux**
React Redux is the official React binding for Redux. It lets your React components read data from a Redux store, and dispatch actions to the store to update data.
```bash
npm install react-redux
```
