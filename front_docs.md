1. use **styled-components** to enhance CSS for styling React component

It turns css into js files and makes maintenance a lot easier. So we don't have to hunt across different files to find the styling affecting a specific component.

```bash
npm install styled-components
```

[styled-components/styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components)


2. use **redux** to manage data and components

```bash
npm install redux
```
[redux](https://redux.js.org/)
